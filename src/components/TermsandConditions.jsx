</div>

<div className="mb-6">
  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Informal Resolution</h3>
  <p className="text-lg mb-6">
    You and BUZZHUB LLC agree that good-faith informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, low-cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and BUZZHUB LLC therefore agree that, before either you or BUZZHUB LLC demands arbitration against the other, we will personally meet and confer, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to resolve informally any claim covered by this mutual Arbitration Agreement. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you shall also fully participate in the conference. 
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg mb-6">
    The party initiating the claim must give notice to the other party in writing of its, his, or her intent to initiate an informal dispute resolution conference, which shall occur within 60 days after the other party receives such notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg mb-6">
    To notify BUZZHUB LLC that you intend to initiate an informal dispute resolution conference, email <a href="mailto:admin@buzzhubapp.com" className="text-blue-500">admin@buzzhubapp.com</a>: providing your name, telephone number, email address, and a description of your claim. In the interval between the party receiving such notice and the informal dispute resolution conference, the parties shall be free to attempt to resolve the initiating party’s claims. Engaging in an informal dispute resolution conference is a requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process required by this paragraph.
  </p>
</div>

<div className="mb-6">
  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Arbitration Rules and Forum</h3>
  <p className="text-lg mb-6">
    This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) in all respects. If for whatever reason the rules and procedures of the FAA cannot apply, the state law governing arbitration agreements in the state in which you reside shall apply.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg mb-6">
    Before a party may begin an arbitration proceeding, that party must send notice of an intent to initiate arbitration and certifying completion of the informal dispute resolution conference pursuant to paragraph 11(b). If this notice is being sent to BUZZHUB LLC, it must be sent by email to the counsel who represented BUZZHUB LLC in the informal dispute resolution process, or to PO box 1433 Waterville, ME 04901.
  </p>
</div>

<div className="mb-6">
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Arbitration and Dispute Resolution</h2>
  
  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Scope of Arbitration</h3>
  <p className="text-lg mb-6">
    The arbitration will be conducted by an ADR Service of BUZZHUB LLC's choosing, under its rules and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Arbitration demands filed must include:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-decimal pl-8 space-y-4 text-lg mb-6">
    <li>The name, telephone number, mailing address, and e-mail address of the party seeking arbitration;</li>
    <li>A statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims;</li>
    <li>A description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good-faith calculation of the amount in controversy, enumerated in United States Dollars (any request for injunctive relief or attorneys’ fees shall not count toward the calculation of the amount in controversy unless such injunctive relief seeks the payment of money);</li>
    <li>The signature of the party seeking arbitration.</li>
  </ul>
  <p className="text-lg mb-6">
    BUZZHUB LLC will pay their portion of the initial case opening fees (if any) that exceed the filing fee to file the case in a court of competent jurisdiction embracing the location of the arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitration fees will be governed by the ADR Services rules. Each party will be responsible for paying their own ADR service fees, including filing, administrative, hearing, and/or other fees. If an ADR service is unavailable, the parties will mutually select an alternative arbitral forum.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg mb-6">
    You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, video conference, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Arbitrator Powers</h3>
  <p className="text-lg mb-6">
    The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. 
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg mb-6">
    All disputes regarding the payment of arbitrator or arbitration-organization fees, including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment, shall be determined exclusively by an arbitrator, and not by any court. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and BUZZHUB LLC. 
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg mb-6">
    Except as expressly agreed to in Section 11(g) of this Agreement, the arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other proceedings or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award, on an individual basis, monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement (including this Arbitration Agreement).
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg mb-6">
    The arbitrator will issue a written statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award shall be binding only among the parties and shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a different party. The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on you and BUZZHUB LLC.
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Waiver of Jury Trial</h3>
  <p className="text-lg mb-6">
    YOU AND BUZZHUB LLC WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND RECEIVE A JUDGE OR JURY TRIAL. You and BUZZHUB LLC are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration, except as specified in Section 11(a) above. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</h3>
  <p className="text-lg mb-6">
    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY AGREED TO IN SECTION 11(g) OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND BUZZHUB LLC AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RESOLVE CLAIMS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 11(g). CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 11(g).
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg mb-6">
    If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or dispute, neither you nor BUZZHUB LLC is entitled to arbitration of such claim or dispute. Instead, all such claims and disputes will then be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 15. This provision does not prevent you or BUZZHUB LLC from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.

  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Batch Arbitrations</h3>
  <p className="text-lg mb-6">
    To increase efficiency of resolution, in the event 100 or more similar arbitration demands against BUZZHUB LLC, presented by or with the assistance of the same law firm or organization, are submitted to an arbitration provider selected in accordance with the rules described above within a 30-day period, the arbitration provider shall:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-decimal pl-8 space-y-4 text-lg mb-6">
    <li>Group the arbitration demands into batches of no more than 100 demands per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining demands); and</li>
    <li>Provide for resolution of each batch as a single arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees and one arbitrator assigned per batch.</li>
  </ul>
  <p className="text-lg mb-6">
    You agree to cooperate in good faith with BUZZHUB LLC and the arbitration provider to implement such a batch approach to resolution and fees.
